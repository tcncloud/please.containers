# Please containers rules

This project attempts to provide a set of rules for container image manipulation in [please](https://github.com/thought-machines/please).
The rules are inspired and use the bazel's [rules_docker](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting/incidents/0.licg5733pzpf?project=tcn-cloud-dev).
